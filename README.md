# coding4ch: Coding for Cultural Heritage

This repository serves as the code-base for utilities useful in cultural heritage imaging and mass digitization projects. It is **VERY** much a work in progress . . .

This repository was initially announced at the [2020 DT West Coast Round Table](https://dtculturalheritage.com/events/dt-west-coast-round-table-pepperdine/) at Pepperdine University in Malibu, CA on March 12, 2020.

## Getting Started

**Work in progress**

The following steps are necessary to install a development copy of this repository on your computer. This will allow you to assist in the development of this software.

Once the development environments have been decided, more easily distributable installation packages could be created for those interested in simply using the software. **If you want installable programs contact us by email coding4ch@gmail.com and let us know!**

We are actively working on instructions for macOS versions 10.14 Mojave and 10.15 Catalina and Ubuntu 18.04LTS. All instructions will tested be on a very limited number of computers. *Please reach out and ask for assistance or help if you're having trouble with any of these steps.*

If there is interest, a Virtual Machine could be created for use on Windows 10 and for those on any operating system who just want to start working with the code **If you want a pre-loaded virtual machine contact us by email coding4ch@gmail.com and let us know!**
